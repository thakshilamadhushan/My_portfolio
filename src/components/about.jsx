            <p>I’m a passionate Full-Stack and Web Developer who enjoys building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I focus on creating clean UI, efficient backend systems, and scalable solutions using modern web technologies.
                Beyond web development, I have a strong interest in electronics and IoT, where I enjoy working with ESP32 and Arduino to build smart, connected systems that interact with real-world data.
                When I’m not coding or building circuits, I enjoy nature photography, capturing landscapes and moments that inspire creativity and attention to detail—skills that also influence my design and development work.</p>
